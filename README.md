# No More Monkey Business

This mod tightens the leash on Monkeys, If a monkey is chasing a player and they cross a biome/area line that is not close to their home they will de-aggro and go back.

**NOTE:** This does not work on Shadow Monkeys as I dont want to reduce their potential to kill you if you stop holding W.
